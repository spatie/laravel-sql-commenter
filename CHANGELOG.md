### Upgrade guide

You can no longer call `SqlCommenter::addComment` statically, you now need to fetch the commenter instance from the container or have it dependency injected into your code.

```diff
- SqlCommenter::addComment('My comment');
+ app(SqlCommenter::class)->addComment('My comment');


```
